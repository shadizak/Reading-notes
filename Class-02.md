# This is Important Artical 

## Today we are going to talk about texts in HTML

1. Headings and paragraphs
2. Bold, italic, emphasis
3. Structural and semantic markup
 
 
 ### Headings
 
HTML has six "levels" of headings:
<h1> is used for main headings <h2> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...
Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6> element is the smallest. The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser. You will see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS.
_For Example_
 
```
html>
    <body>
         <h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
         <h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
         <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
         <h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
         <h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
         <h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>
         
    </body>
</html>
```
### Paragraphs 
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.
By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.
 _For Example_
 
```
    <p>Shadi</p>
    <p>Zaqout</p>
 ```
### Bold & iTalic 

1. ``` <b> ```
By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
The <b> element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the <b> element does not imply any additional meaning.

2. ``` <i> ```
By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
The <i> element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content â€” such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.
  
### Superscript and Subscript
1. ``` <sup> ```
The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.

2. ``` <sub> ```
The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.
